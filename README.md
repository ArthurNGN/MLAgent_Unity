Dear User

The goal of this course is to introduce you the concept of machine learning through a fun and interactive way using Unity.

This repo contains the content of a Unity's project Assets folder.

To set the project up, make sure that you have both unity and mlagents module installed with all its dependencies.
You might also want to have a virtual environment running in your terminal with mlagent-learn -h and onnx installed to perform the training process process

Create a new Unity 3D project and paste and replace all the files from the repo in your Assets folder.
Note that you have a trained brain provided to compare your result ;)

You may now follow the provided course,
Enjoy !
